IoT Device Management Server running on node.js.

• Leverages MQTT as an optional side-chain transport layer.

• Serves as an IoT device registration endpoint while storing device data using CouchDB server and Redis session-store.

• Application is a back-end data provider (security agent) for RTM admin console running on the same server (currently on Apache, but should converge to NGINX).

• Provides control to a build server that pushes new firmware versions to client applications (FCM push) and devices (MQTT).

## Supported IoT Platforms

* ESP8266 (thinx-firmware-esp8266)
* Tested on Wemos D1 Mini, Wemos D1 Mini Pro, Robodyn D1, Robodyn D1 Mini and NodeMCU with Arduino, LUA and Micropython-based core firmwares
* Expected: Any Arduino with networking support.

## Prerequisites

* Linux Server (possibly Raspberry Pi but not tested)
* API runs on HTTP port 7442 (possibly HTTPS 7443) and 7447 (websocket)
* MQTT runs on HTTP port 1883 (possibly HTTPS 8883)
* Admin runs on HTTP/HTTPS port (80/443)

## Installation

Easiest install is through [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/suculent/thinx-docker/).

## Endpoints (deprecated)

See 03-test.sh. There is no point of maintaining documentation for this at current stage of development and user base zero.
